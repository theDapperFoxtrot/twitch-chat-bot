# twitch-chat-bot
My chat bot for my Twitch stream! 

I've had a lot of fun practicing Node.js and this JS package from https://tmijs.com/.

Having commands that enable engagement with my growing community (when I can't always be attentive) is a really wonderful feature! Rather than having commands run by some third-party such as Nightbot, I can use my own username to interact until I can regain attention, and make something fun for chatters to be enticed by. I love being able to make people feel noticed when I'm concentrating a bit too hard on my code! Haha
